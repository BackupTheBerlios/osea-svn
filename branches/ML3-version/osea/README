öSea System
===========

Open Secure System for Enterprise Applications

Requisites:
===========

Both servers and client need Roadrunner. You must install the last
version of RoadRunner. Download it from http://rr.codefactory.se.  If
you experiment problems compiling öSea system against the last stable
version, please checkout the CVS version and try with it.

You must install the last version of LibGDA in machines where servers
will be installed. Download it from http://www.gnome-db.org, or use
the last libgda package for your distribution.  If you experiment
problems using öSea system against the last stable version, please
checkout the CVS version and try with it.


Installing, configuring öSea system
===================================

Server side
-----------

1) Servers installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

öSea system server side consists on several different servers. Each one
can be installed in a different machine.

For running öS-Kernel, you will need to install the following
components, in the next order:

* liboseacomm
* liboseaclient
* libaoskernel
* liboseaserver
* os-kernel

For running os-tax, you will need to install the following components,
in the next order:

* liboseacomm
* liboseaclient
* libaoskernel
* liboseaserver
* os-tax

2) Database setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After that, you must initialize database. öSea system uses PostgreSQL
as database management system. The database server can be installed in
any machine, but it must be accesible from os-* servers.

You can taylor this installation method for your machines. Here, our
database server is at the same machine where the other servers run, and
we've got root access. You can also contribute with other database
installation methods for including them in this document.

* First of all, you need to configure your postgresql daemon for it to
  authenticate oinvoice users against passwords using crypt
  (postgresql <= 6.2) or md5 (postgresql >= 6.3).

  Depending your preexisting PostgreSQL configuration, you will need
  to customize this PostgreSQL 6.3 settings (this are the setting I
  use for my machine, without any other application needing
  PostgreSQL):

  /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf
  ---------------------------
  # TYPE  DATABASE    USER        IP-ADDRESS        IP-MASK           METHOD
 
    local   all       root                                            ident sameuser
    local   all       postgres                                        ident sameuser
    local   all       all                                             md5
    host    all       all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   md5
    host    all       all         192.168.0.0       255.255.254.0     md5
    host    all       all         0.0.0.0           255.255.255.255   reject

  ---------

  This configuration allows users root and postgres connecting against
  database without a password, and makes all other users from
  localhost and the LAN to connect using md5 as authenticating method
  (so öInvoice users should be authenticated for connecting to the
  database). Connections that not match with any of the previous rules
  are rejected.


* After changing pg_hba.conf, restart postgresql
  ("/etc/init.d/postgresql restart" in debian)

* Now you must create osea database. The installation script is in
  os-kernel/data/create_database.sql. If you want to use another
  database name, you shall change all database installation scripts.

  For creating database, login as postgres user:

  ----
  root@kolbe:~# su - postgres
  postgres@kolbe:~$ 
  ----

  Connect to PostgreSQL default database

  ----
  postgres@kolbe:~$ psql template1
  Welcome to psql 7.3.2, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.
 
  Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
         \h for help with SQL commands
         \? for help on internal slash commands
         \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
         \q to quit
 
  template1=#
  ----

  Now, execute database creation script:

  ----
  template1=# \i /usr/src/osea/os-kernel/data/create_database.sql
  ----

  After creating that, logout from psql

  ----
  template1=# \q
  postgres@kolbe:~$
  ----

  Now you must connect, as postgres user, to the just created
  database:

  ----
  postgres@kolbe:$ psql osea
  Welcome to psql 7.3.2, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.
 
  Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
         \h for help with SQL commands
         \? for help on internal slash commands
         \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
         \q to quit
 
  osea=#
  ____

  Now, you must install the corresponding tables in the database. So
  you should install tables for every installed server:

  ----
  osea=# \i /usr/src/osea/os-kernel/data/install.sql
  osea=# \i /usr/src/oinvoice/os-tax/data/install.sql
  ----
 
  And so on with all the installed servers...
  

3) Setting up servers configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Now you must customize configuration for all the servers.
  Copy os-*.cfg.example files to os-*.cfg, and edit them to show your
  actual configuration.

4) Start servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Now you only need to start servers properly. The only requisite is
  that you must start os-kernel first.




Client side
-----------

In the client side, you must install the components following the next
order:

* liboseacomm
* liboseaclient
* libaoskernel
* libaostax
* oinvoice

After that, you can start öInvoice with "oinvoice".
