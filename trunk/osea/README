ASPL Fact
=========

System for commercial management.

(c) 2003, Advanced Software Production Line.


Requisites:
===========

Both servers and client need Roadrunner. You must install the last
version of RoadRunner. Download it from http://rr.codefactory.se.  If
you experiment problems compiling ASPL Fact against the last stable
version, please checkout the CVS version and try with it.

You must install the last version of LibGDA (0.12 or greater) in
machines where servers will be installed. Download it from
http://www.gnome-db.org, or use the last libgda package for your
distribution.  If you experiment problems using ASPL Fact against the
last stable version, please checkout the CVS version and try with it.


Installing, configuring ASPL Fact system
========================================

Server side
-----------

1) Servers installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ASPL Fact server side consists in several different servers. Each one
can be installed in a different machine.

For running af-kernel, you will need to install the following
components, in the next order:

* libcoyote
* libafdal
* libafdalkernel
* libafgs
* af-kernel

For running af-tax, you will need to install the following components,
in the next order:

* libcoyote
* libafdal
* libafdalkernel
* libafgs
* af-tax

2) Database setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After that, you must initialize database. ASPL Fact uses PostgreSQL as
database management system. The database server can be installed in any
machine, but it must be accesible from af-* servers.

You can taylor this installation method for your machines. Here, our
database server is at the same machine where the other servers run, and
we've got root access. You can also contribute with other database
installation methods for including them in this document.

* First of all, you need to configure your postgresql daemon for it to
  authenticate aspl-fact users against passwords using crypt
  (postgresql <= 6.2) or md5 (postgresql >= 6.3).

  Depending your preexisting PostgreSQL configuration, you will need
  to customize this PostgreSQL 6.3 settings (this are the setting I
  use for my machine, without any other application needing
  PostgreSQL):

  /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf
  ---------------------------
  # TYPE  DATABASE    USER        IP-ADDRESS        IP-MASK           METHOD
 
    local   all       root                                            ident sameuser
    local   all       postgres                                        ident sameuser
    local   all       all                                             md5
    host    all       all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   md5
    host    all       all         192.168.0.0       255.255.254.0     md5
    host    all       all         0.0.0.0           255.255.255.255   reject

  ---------

  This configuration allows users root and postgres connecting against
  database without a password, and makes all other users from
  localhost and the LAN to connect using md5 as authenticating method
  (so ASPL Fact users should be authenticated for connecting to the
  database). Connections that not match with any of the previous rules
  are rejected.


* After changing pg_hba.conf, restart postgresql
  ("/etc/init.d/postgresql restart" in debian)

* Now you must create asplfact database. The installation script is in
  af-kernel/data/create_database.sql. If you want to use another
  database name, you shall change all database installation scripts.

  For creating database, login as postgres user:

  ----
  root@kolbe:~# su - postgres
  postgres@kolbe:~$ 
  ----

  Connect to PostgreSQL default database

  ----
  postgres@kolbe:~$ psql template1
  Welcome to psql 7.3.2, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.
 
  Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
         \h for help with SQL commands
         \? for help on internal slash commands
         \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
         \q to quit
 
  template1=#
  ----

  Now, execute database creation script:

  ----
  template1=# \i /usr/src/aspl-fact/af-kernel/data/create_database.sql
  ----

  After creating that, logout from psql

  ----
  template1=# \q
  postgres@kolbe:~$
  ----

  Now you must connect, as postgres user, to the just created
  database:

  ----
  postgres@kolbe:$ psql asplfact
  Welcome to psql 7.3.2, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.
 
  Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
         \h for help with SQL commands
         \? for help on internal slash commands
         \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
         \q to quit
 
  asplfact=#
  ____

  Now, you must install the corresponding tables in the database. So
  you should install tables for every installed server:

  ----
  asplfact=# \i /usr/src/aspl-fact/af-tax/data/install.sql
  asplfact=# \i /usr/src/aspl-fact/af-kernel/data/install.sql
  ----
 
  And so on with all the installed servers...
  

3) Setting up servers configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Now you must customize configuration for all the servers.
  Copy af-*.cfg.example files to af-*.cfg, and edit them to show your
  actual configuration.

4) Start servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Now you only need to start servers properly. The only requisite is
  that you must start af-kernel first.




Client side
-----------

In the client side, you must install the components following the next
order:

* libcoyote
* libafdal
* libafdalkernel
* libafdaltax
* aspl-fact

After that, you can start aspl-fact.
